# NeuralNetsGA
Repository containing a project that targets evolving neural nets using genetic algorithms.

## Technology
Python 3.7
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn

## Progress
Finished working on new version, now it provides better results,

## ToDo

Now it is time to prepare mechanism for evolving achitecture of NN.

## References

Neural Net numpy implementation is partly taken from:
https://www.kaggle.com/niyipop/2-layer-neural-network-from-scratch-using-numpy/data

However, I added biases and new activation functions.

Genetic algorithm implementation was adapted from author's own repository:
