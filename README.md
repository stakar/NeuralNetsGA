# NeuralNetsGA
Repository containing a project that targets evolving neural nets using genetic algorithms.

## Technology
Python 3.7
Numpy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn

## Progress
Finished first version, uploaded presentation of results.

## ToDo

Next step is adding more interesting activation functions, and prepare it for evolving not only weights,
but also architecture of NN.
